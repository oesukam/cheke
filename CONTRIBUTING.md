## We ðŸ’œ contributions

While we love contributions, we also need to ensure that our library is of great quality. Thus we require you to follow some simple guidelines when you're submitting your contributions.

## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/oesukam/cheke/issues) to make sure your issue hasnâ€™t already been reported.

## Development

Visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/oesukam/cheke/issues) to find a list of open issues that need attention.

Fork, then clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/oesukam/cheke.git
```

### Testing

To run tests:

```
npm run test // Will run tests once
```

To continuously watch and run tests, run the following:

```
npm run test:watch
```

### Linting

To Lint

```
npm run lint
```

### Building

To build run:

```
npm run build
```

### Quality insurance

The `build` command should handle it but always run the `lint` command to ensure we are all developing with the same code standards.

### Submitting a Pull Request

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. We donâ€™t want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we wonâ€™t want to accept.

On the other hand, sometimes the best way to start a conversation _is_ to send a pull request. Use your best judgement!

1. Open a new issue in the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/oesukam/cheke/issues)
1. Fork the repo
1. Create a new feature branch based off the `master` branch
1. Create breaking test(s) before implementing any fixes or functionality
1. Make your changes
1. Submit a pull request, referencing any issue that it resolves

Thank you, we ðŸ’œ your contributions!
